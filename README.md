# Create Password Generate Function

## Description
We were tasked with finishing the code provided by adding a generate function in the javascript file. Originally the website would not function properly but now it runs as expected: generating a random passcode with provided criteria.This was done successfully by utilizing conditional statements and iteration.



## Usage

To use this website click the live link or open the html file included in this repository.
